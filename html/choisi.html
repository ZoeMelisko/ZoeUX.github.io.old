        <div>        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Choisi currently serves a purpose as a lookbook that directs users to designer sites causing a bounce rate of 60%. Additionally, the company has had difficulty implementing their own AI technology because of limitations with their website hosting platform. Choisi's founder, Sherry Soliman, came to us with two goals:

                Decrease the site’s bounce rate by at least 10%
                Create a personalized shopping experience on the current site that doesn't utilize AI</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="grid-2 grid-1">
        <div>
        <h2>The Current Experience</h2>
        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>I collected the teams notes of the current site and put together a heuristic evaluation, a common theme emerged: each product image directed to affiliate links. We hypothesized that this probably the source of significant efficiency, memorability, and satisfaction issues with users.</p>
        <p>I further investigated Choisi's architecture by breaking it down into a site map that shows that discoverability on the site occurs solely through a user clicking on a designer name and hoping that they design items the user wants.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="grid-2">on>
        <div>
        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <p>Additionally, we conducted several usability tests on the current site to understand an average user flow when attempting specific task scenarios. Our initial assumptions and frustrations were validated when users also found themselves clicking on a product image and then taken to about four separate external sites.</p>

        <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <p>Choisi hasn't been able to fully developed a strong demographic due to their evolving state, however they primarily capture a female demographic. We kept this in mind when interviewing and made a conscious decision to talk with a diverse group of women in terms of age and economic standings. We hit the streets and interviewed across LA from trendy Abbot Kinney to suburban Calabasas and ended up conducting several interviews that helped us grasp the wants and needs of the luxury fashion consumer. </p>
        <p>Despite the range of interviewees, nearly all women voiced the same understanding that luxury fashion means having an effortless experience catered to individual needs and provides impeccable quality and attention to detail of a product.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Users</h2>
        <p>We began analyzing our research by pulling key information from our interviews and forming patterns of users expectations from a luxury fashion experience in store and online. It became overwhelmingly clear that people expect high quality materials, a personal interaction, and an effortless experience from beginning to end.
            From here we were able to prioritize features primarily focused on the users but also taking into consideration the clients expectations as well.</p>

        <h2>Forming Personas</h2>
        <p>To help us redesign a Choisi experience that considered all users, we created two personas to address the range of potential shoppers. Our primary persona, Celeste, helped us understand the typical luxury shopper, while Elise helped us realize the special experience that Choisi could provide for more economical shoppers. The journey map below depicts Celeste's experience as she attempts to find and purchase a unique dress for the upcoming James Beard Awards Gala.</p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>Our ideation process began with rough sketching and a collaborative design studio with our stakeholder to share our design thinking. Our users told us that if they’re going to buy luxury, the site should exemplify that via high-end design. We accomplished this by focused on a clean, editorial feel with large, lifestyle images, white space while maintaining the company’s current branding. After establishing a fundamental style we conducted several rounds of A/B testing with slightly different layouts to explore further options.</p>

        <div>
        <h2>Lo-Fi Phase</h2>
        <h3>Paper Prototyping</h3>
        <p>We created greyscale wireframes from the most successful page layouts from our A/B testing and conducted usability tests with paper prototypes and iterated a few small changes like text size.</p>
        <h3>Design Review</h3>
        <p>Afterward we displayed our wireframes in a shared work space to get as much feedback as possible on the design before moving forward with mockups.</p>

        <div>
        <h2>Hi-Fi Phase</h2>
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Editor’s Picks: I re-labeled and redesigned the site’s current “Top 10 Lists” to “Editor’s Picks” so users like Celeste know that they are looking at items hand-picked by trusted fashion curators.</p>
        <h3>Personalization</h3>
        <p>Finish the Look: On product detail pages, users can get suggestions on what goes with the item they’re looking at so they can build an entire look vs. just buying an individual piece. This adds a sense of personal styling without heavy duty AI technology.</p>
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>Shop This Look: No matter the style, users can now discover and purchase completed looks that accommodate different trends and occasions.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Final Product</h2>
        <p>We presented the high fidelity prototype redesign with all of our research findings, usability testing results, and final high fidelity prototype. We also provided further suggestions in response to final round of testing with users.</p>
        <h3>The Results</h3>
        <p>Users were pleased with a clean, beautiful site that allowed them to shop with ease and guided them to more personalized, more seamless purchasing decisions.</p>
        <p>We documented that previously users could spend as little as 7 seconds on the site before bouncing to an affiliate link. In final usability tests, users spent between 3-5 minutes browsing the site and completing their purchase. </p>
        </div>

    <section class="grid-2">
        <h2>Behind the REsults</h2>
        <h3>Revised Site Map & User Flows</h3>
        <p>Our revised site map now illustrates the more robust navigation schema that provides users with much more familiar shopping experience. The design also allows many ways for users to shop whether it's via designer, Instagram, or item type. We saw this new structures success in action with our new user flow in which users were never taken to an external site and can easily accomplish purchasing products in just minutes.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="grid-2">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>It was truly a pleasure working with my team and the company's founder to make such impactful solutions for users and help grow the Choisi vision. My main takeaway from this project is how to design for the unknown. We were challenged to design for personalization while the client was still fleshing out how to implement AI technology on the backend. Additionally, Choisi's undefined user base and the projects restraints led us to interview a diverse group of potential users that may not have enough experience/knowledge of luxury fashion to provide meaningful insights. If I were to go back, I would spend more time researching and testing with Choisi’s key demographic which could've helped us better validate and iterate our design choices to provide the best possible solution for real users experiences.</p>
    </section>
        <h3>What's Next?</h3>
        <p>In a second design sprint I would like to expand research, continue iterating, and testing but I would also enjoy exploring more personalization and engaging features that were outside our previous scope such as:

            Create user generated content features similar to the "Editor's Picks" to further more user engagement and product discovery on the site.
            Build out more personalization features that compliment the AI technology when it's implemented such as a style survey upon account creation.</p>
