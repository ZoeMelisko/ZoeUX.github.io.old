                    <h4>Choisi came to us with two problems:</h4>
                    <p><b>1. Currently, 60% of users are bouncing from Choisi almost immediately after visiting the site,.</b></p>
                    <p><b>2. Currently, Choisi's AI technology can't be implemented so they need personalization features that will complement the AI once it's launched.</b></p>
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>Deliver a full site redesign in a 2.5 week sprint focused on e-commerce functionality and incorporating personalization features to keep users engaged on Choisi.</p>
                    <!--<p>How might we integrate personalization features on this luxury fashion site to decrease bounce rates by at least 10%?</p>-->

Understanding this, we decided to deliver a redesign that Sherry's startup team could confidently implement ASAP to their current site to potentially grow their user base while they developed their relaunch.</p>

            <p class="text-chunk-1">An initial run through of Choisi's site presented a huge friction point: <b>no e-commerce functionality.</b> While the site did have a curated group of global designers for users to select from, <b>it lacked any way to browse, filter, or purchase products without redirecting to external designer sites.</b> The lack of engaging e-commerce functionality became our hypothesis as to why users were bouncing from the site at such high rates.</p>

                    <p>Conducting a heuristic evaluation was essential for my team to document components of the site that might cause a users pain points at a broad scale. From this <b>we found several areas to improve user recognition and efficiency</b>, primarily regarding the navigation and consistent site redirects.</p>

                    <p>In Choisi's current state real-world users were essentially non-existent. This caused my team to pivot, <b>deciding to interview a variety of potential users who are frequent fashion consumers ranging in age, income, and shopping habits</b>.</p>
                    <p>Interviewees had mixed experiences with the luxury fashion world but when it came to online shopping <b>all largely agreed that products should be easy to browse/find, details of product/designer are valuable, and personal customer service goes a long way.</b></p>

                    <p>When comparing Choisi to their competitors, we found consistent content, features, and themes across the board. This method helped frame the structure and aesthetic in our redesign phase.</p>
                    <p><b>Common Structures and Features:</b> Categories/filters, latest trends, wish lists, featured products, styling advice, product details, highlighted designers.</p>

                    <p>As it turns out, user were just as frustrated as us when navigating simple tasks. <b>In fact, users spent most of their time being redirected and navigating their way farther from the Choisi site altogether.</b></p>

                    <p><b>Celeste the “Inspo Seeker/High Spender,"</b> frequently purchases luxury pieces that inspire her. She's frustrated when a site lacks style inspiration or if purchasing process takes too long.</p>
                    <p><b>Elise the “Investment Spender,”</b> occasionally invests in luxury pieces after researching brands/designers/product details. She's loyal to high-quality, ethically sourced brands and is frustrated when she can't find products up to her standards.</p>

                    <p>To visualize Celeste's current Choisi experience I created a Journey Map of her thoughts and emotions at specific touchpoints while completing the following scenario: </p>
                    <p>Celeste is preparing for her biggest career opportunity yet as a judge for the LA Food Fest. She can’t find anything inspiring enough in her closet for such an important event. Her goal is to use this press opportunity to spotlight a unique emerging designer. </p>

Our users told us that if they’re going to buy luxury products, they expect the experience to reflect luxury via high-end design. We accomplished this by <b>focusing on a clean, editorial feel with large, lifestyle images, white space that elevates Choisi's online presence</b>. After establishing a fundamental style we conducted several rounds of <b>A/B testing</b> with different layouts to explore the best content hierarchy for users.</p>

                <h2>Product Discovery Features</h2>
                <p><b>"Editor’s Picks":</b> We re-labeled and redesigned the site’s current “Top 10 Lists” to “Editor’s Picks," a small change that strengthens Choisi's credibility for users like Elise who values authentic brands.</p>
                <p><b>"Designer Spotlight":</b> My team saw a lot of opportunity to promote user discovery by highlighting designers right on the homepage. Users are then taken to designer pages where they can view full collections and purchase available products without leaving Choisi's site.</p>
                <p><b>"Shoppers Also Viewed/You May like":</b> To further increase user engagement we added components that encourages users to explore what other users view and provide product suggestions in the checkout flow for any last minute purchases.</p>

                <p><b>"Shop the Look":</b> Provides users with head to toe looks that they can purchase as a complete stylish outfit or as a separate that they can envision working with their own clothes based of the outfit shown.</p>

                    <p>When comparing Choisi's current structure, our revised site map now provides a robust navigation schema that provides users with . The design also allows many avenues for users to shop whether it's via designer, Instagram, or item type.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p><b>Small changes make all the difference:</b> In this project I realized that the simplest components like "Sort by" options are empowering tools for users to create a better experience for themselves.</p>
                <p><b>Not all feedback is valuable feedback:</b>Without real-world users we relied on interviewees and usability feedback from outside our key demographic. We really had to evaluate the worth of changing and/or adding features based on user feedback that didn't necessarily align with the luxury fashion space.</p>
