                        <p><b>2. Currently, they use two different independent companies to handle their e-Commerce functions causing a confusing user flow.</b></p>

Understanding this, we decided to deliver a redesign that Sherry's startup team could confidently implement ASAP to their current site to potentially grow their user base while they developed their relaunch.</p>

                    <h3>Where are the problem areas?</h3>
                    <p>My first step in this phase was to experience the Burger Records site for myself in order to fully identify its function(s). I discovered that the site primarily serves as an e-commerce experience, however, it is also used as a demo submission platform, social media hub, and for event discovery. This site layout and structure differs drastically from typical e-commerce practices that drastically affected users learnability, memorability, and overall satisfaction (and dare I say their delight as well).</p>

                    <h3>Who is the competition?</h3>
                    <p>When comparing Choisi to their competitors, we found consistent content, features, and themes across the board. This method helped frame the structure and aesthetic in our redesign phase.</p>
                    <p><b>Common Structures and Features:</b> Categories/filters, latest trends, wish lists, featured products, styling advice, product details, highlighted designers.</p>
                    <p><b>Common Visuals:</b> Large amounts of white space with an emphasis on colorful fashion shots.</p>

                    <h3>How do users navigate Choisi now?</h3>
                    <p>To fully validate our hypothesis we observed users as they attempted to complete either Task #1 or Task #2.</p>
                    <p>As it turns out, user were just as frustrated as us when navigating simple tasks. <b>In fact, users spent most of their time being redirected and navigating their way farther from the Choisi site altogether.</b></p>
                    <p>One user even stated, <b>“Why would I even bother with Choisi if I just ended up on Etsy and could buy the product there?”</b></p>

                    <p><b>Celeste the “Inspo Seeker/High Spender,"</b> frequently purchases luxury pieces that inspire her. She's frustrated when a site lacks style inspiration or if purchasing process takes too long.</p>

                    <p>Celeste is preparing for her biggest career opportunity yet as a judge for the LA Food Fest. She can’t find anything inspiring enough in her closet for such an important event. Her goal is to use this press opportunity to spotlight a unique emerging designer. </p>

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>Our ideation process began with <b>rough sketching</b> and a <b>collaborative design studio</b> with the founder, Sherry, to share our design thinking. Our users told us that if they’re going to buy luxury products, they expect the experience to reflect luxury via high-end design. We accomplished this by <b>focusing on a clean, editorial feel with large, lifestyle images, white space that elevates Choisi's online presence</b>. After establishing a fundamental style we conducted several rounds of <b>A/B testing</b> with different layouts to explore the best content hierarchy for users.</p>

                    <p>We took a standard approach when incorporating e-commerce components, creating an intuitive user flow was the main priority of my team. We designed a familiar navigation structure and robust filtering options by designer, style, and even occasion for users in similar scenarios as our persona Celeste.</p>
                    <p>Smaller details such as breadcrumbs, "Sort by" categories, and page view options may be overlooked by users but .</p>

                <h2>Product Discovery Features</h2>
                <p><b>"Editor’s Picks":</b> We re-labeled and redesigned the site’s current “Top 10 Lists” to “Editor’s Picks," a small change that strengthens Choisi's credibility for users like Elise who values authentic brands.</p>
                <p><b>"Designer Spotlight":</b> My team saw a lot of opportunity to promote user discovery by highlighting designers right on the homepage. Users are then taken to designer pages where they can view full collections and purchase available products without leaving Choisi's site.</p>
                <p><b>"Shoppers Also Viewed/You May like":</b> To further increase user engagement we added components that encourages users to explore what other users view and provide product suggestions in the checkout flow for any last minute purchases.</p>

                <p><b>"Finish the Look":</b> On product detail pages, users can get suggestions on what goes with the item they’re looking at so they can build an entire look vs. just buying an individual piece. This adds a sense of personal styling without heavy duty AI technology.</p>
                <p><b>"Shop the Look":</b> Provides users with head to toe looks that they can purchase as a complete stylish outfit or as a separate that they can envision working with their own clothes based of the outfit shown.</p>

                <p>Users were pleased with a clean, beautiful site that allowed them to shop with ease and guided them to more personalized, more seamless purchasing decisions. </p>
                <p>We documented that previously users could spend as little as 7 seconds on the site before bouncing to an affiliate link. In final usability tests, users spent between 3-5 minutes browsing the site and completing their purchase, a huge improvement.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p>I appreciated the chance to work on such a fun site and I'm confident with the end result and user response to it. Personally, my biggest takeaway from working on this project is to think more critically of all the information and ask more questions to make sure the right problems are being pinpointed before diving into creating solutions. If I could go back I would have gathered more interviews to build a better foundation of the record store shoppers and I would have conducted a contextual inquiry at the Fullerton location to narrow my scope to serve Burger Records key demographic.</p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <p>I’m confident these changes provide significant improvement in the site’s overall user experience. From here, my next sprint would include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Continue testing with a more diverse group of analog music consumers and tackle more of the business end functionality, such as the demo submission process or becoming a partner. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Explore the implementation of more personalized elements of the site such as band recommendations based on a users purchases</p></li>
                    <li><p>Further hone in on the branding and design of the site and provide fun interaction design to bring more life into the experience</p></li>
                </ul>
