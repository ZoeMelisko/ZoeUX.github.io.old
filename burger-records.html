                    <p class="text-chunk-1">To focus the problems I faced during the initial site walk through, I decided to conduct a Heuristic Evaluation. This helped me address friction points that are strictly related to usability and break them down into solvable parts rather than tackling all the problems at once.</p>
                    <p><b>Key takeaway:</b></p>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">Most usability issues found stemmed from changing navigation and layout patterns across the main Burger Records site and their shop.</p>

                <div class="preview-text-chunks" id="user-quotes-text">
                    <h3>How is the site structured?</h3>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">I put together a site map to illustrate the information architecture and hierarchy of pages. It wasn’t until this breakdown that I realized that the “Shop” and “Shirts/Totes” navigation links redirect to two separate e-commerce sites hosted by 3rd party merchandise distributors. </p>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">These 2 shops have user interfaces that are deceptively similar to Burger Records main site and the only indication that you left the main site is a slight change in the URL. This stood out to me as a huge red flag when it comes to a users sense of trust and security when making purchases through these sites.</p>

                    <h3>Who is the competition?</h3>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">I conducted 2 different competitive and comparative analysis, one to tackle standard features used across the independent music distribution space and another focused on layout comparison to begin strategizing Burger Records new content hierarchy.</p>
                    <p><b>Key Takeaway:</b></p>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">While Burger Records contains nearly all the features found on their competitors sites, the features are often broken or inefficient. </p>

                    <h3>How do users navigate currently?</h3>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">I created a User Flow chart to evaluate what avenues users take to purchase products in the apparel shop versus the music shop and to consider what path they might take to purchase from both sites.</p>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1"> The two shops shared similarly dysfunctional e-commerce features which caused a laborious process for users to find a product they actually wanted and could purchase. Additionally, if a user wanted to purchase items from both shops they would have to complete two different account creation and transaction processes. </p>

Users immediately knew where to go to find products and can quickly find specific items or just explore new artists like browsing a record shop. The site also encourages users to discover more by featuring products, artists, and also providing recommendations. </p>
