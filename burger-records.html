I performed an audit of the site to understand all the content it provides its users; I found there was little that the site didn't offer which created a confusing experience even at a high level. See how I documented more of my research findings below!</p>

                    <p><b>Key takeaway:</b></p>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">Most usability issues stemmed from changing navigation and layout patterns, therefore, creating consistency for users became my #1 priority.</p>

                    <h3>How is the current site structured?</h3>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">By diagramming the sites architecture, I found the “Shop” and “Shirts/Totes” categories in the navigation redirected to two separate e-commerce sites hosted by two different merchandise distributors. Both 3rd party sites had interfaces that were similar to the actual Burger Records' website but varied in layout and navigation.</p>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1"><b>I considered the use of deceptive 3rd party sites a huge red flag due to the lack of consistency, security, and transparency Burger Records was providing its users.</b></p>

                    <p><b>Key Takeaway:</b></p>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">Most features that competitors had were present but were unreliable when used. Additionally, the current layout of the landing page and product pages lacked the consistency that other music label sites had.</p>

                <div class="preview-text-chunks" id="user-flow-text">
                    <h3>How do users navigate currently?</h3>
                    <p class="text-chunk-1">In usability tests, users found navigating the main Burger Records site and the two e-commerce shops confusing. Once users realized they were required to create accounts on two 3rd party sites they didn't recognize to complete two checkout processes they gave up entirely. In one user's words "...this whole process seems shady to me...finding items isn't easy, and I don't know who got my [purchasing] info. I just don't trust it."</p>

                    <p>The results from my usability tests required me to pivot my design process. In my second round of high fidelity designing, I kept user interviews and the persona more inline with the design thinking and was strict when it came to maintaining the unique feel of the label. </p>
                    <p>I focused on curating a more authentic record shop experience online by creating robust product pages that highlighted artists and their craft to mimic conversations that often happen between record consumers and shop employees. Further testing of this design was met with much better reactions from fans and new users alike along with a more seamless experience overall. </p>

                    <p class="text-chunk-1">During usability tests users who were and weren't familiar with Burger Records immediately knew where to go to find products and quickly found specific items they were looking for. The new design also led users to discover more by featuring products and artists on the homepage and recommending items on product pages.</p>

                <p class="text-chunk-1">As my first UX project, I found that I enjoyed researching and understanding users. However, I underestimated the importance of speaking with users from Burger Records' key demographic. Most users I interviewed were analog "hobbyists" that were unfamiliar with the label's personality which caused a lot of negative feedback on their branding and purposely dated design. My initial interface designs toned down the company's branding which ended up taking all the fun out of the site. My second iteration was much more successful and true to the company's aesthetics and fanbase.</p>

                <p class="text-chunk-1">I really enjoyed working on a site that has such a unique presence in its marketplace. In another design sprint I would:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p class="text-chunk-1">Continue testing with users that are more inline with the analog music consumer demographic and tackle more of the business end functionality, such as the demo submission process.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text-chunk-1">Explore the implementation of more personalized elements of the site such as band recommendations based on a users purchases.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="text-chunk-1">Further hone in on the branding and design of the site and provide fun interaction design to bring more life into the experience.</p></li>
