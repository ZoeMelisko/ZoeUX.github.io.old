                    <h3>What is eSports?</h3>
                    <p>In a nutshell, electronic sports (aka eSports) is organized competition where teams face off against one another playing popular multiplayer video games. This form of entertainment has blown up in recent year and professional gamers are watched worldwide by millions of viewers, who attend live events or use streaming services like Twitch to watch. </p>
                    <p>eSports has been structured to mimic traditional athletic sports which creates familiarity with viewers whether or not they are gamers</p>

                <div class="preview-text-chunks" id="cc-text">
                    <h3>What is on the Upcomer app?</h3>
                    <p>IÂ conducted a content/feature audit that would help us understand the range of content and functionality on the app. Additionally, I also created a visual breakdown of content hierarchy found in each main nav. </p>
                    <p>To my concern, most of the content was stored on the homepage causing it to be at least 4-5 levels deep. It became apparent that deciding what content to keep might prove difficult later in our design phase.</p>

                    <h3>How do users think about navigate Upcomer?</h3>
                    <p>We conducted usability tests with several gamers and non-gamers to observe a wide range pain points. We observed that users had difficulty navigating through the app because the navigation bar disappeared when they click on content finding themselves having to exit the app or tap the back arrow several times before returning to the screen they started on.</p>

                    <h3>Who makes up the eSports community?</h3>
                    <p>To gain a better understanding of our target audience, we interviewed several self described  gamers. These interviews taught us about the frustrations, motivations, and goals of our target users.</p>
                    <p>After all of our eSports research of the eSports world we felt confidently that we could execute interviews and recieve meaningful insights of a variety of eSports fans. We curated an interview guide that sought out people who are avid gamers and/or eSports viewers.</p>
                    <p>Improving ones game is a large reason people look up highlights and join eSports forums</p>
                    <p>Users enjoyed gaming as a way to gather and bond with friends</p>
                    <p>Conversely, trolls are very real in the gaming community so gamers cautiously stick to their primary circle or utilize friends gaming circles to fill out a team</p>

                    <p>Xander quickly opens Upcomer and searches "LA Gladiatorsâ. He scrolls on the team profile and looks at promising posts here and there, but can't find any video highlights. Frustrated, he decides to post in the public Upcomer forum even though an answer is not immediate or guaranteed and decides to look on Reddit and Youtube to find the kill tactic faster.</p>

                <h2>Product Discovery Features</h2>
                <p><b>"Editorâs Picks":</b> We re-labeled and redesigned the siteâs current âTop 10 Listsâ to âEditorâs Picks," a small change that strengthens Choisi's credibility for users like Elise who values authentic brands.</p>
                <p><b>"Designer Spotlight":</b> My team saw a lot of opportunity to promote user discovery by highlighting designers right on the homepage. Users are then taken to designer pages where they can view full collections and purchase available products without leaving Choisi's site.</p>
                <p><b>"Shoppers Also Viewed/You May like":</b> To further increase user engagement we added components that encourages users to explore what other users view and provide product suggestions in the checkout flow for any last minute purchases.</p>

                <h2>Personalization Features</h2>
                <p><b>"Finish the Look":</b> On product detail pages, users can get suggestions on what goes with the item theyâre looking at so they can build an entire look vs. just buying an individual piece. This adds a sense of personal styling without heavy duty AI technology.</p>
                <p><b>"Shop the Look":</b> Provides users with head to toe looks that they can purchase as a complete stylish outfit or as a separate that they can envision working with their own clothes based of the outfit shown.</p>

                <h2>The Results</h2>
                <p>Users were pleased with a clean, beautiful site that allowed them to shop with ease and guided them to more personalized, more seamless purchasing decisions. </p>
                <p>We documented that previously users could spend as little as 7 seconds on the site before bouncing to an affiliate link. In final usability tests, users spent between 3-5 minutes browsing the site and completing their purchase, a huge improvement.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p><b>Small changes make all the difference:</b> In this project I realized that the simplest components like "Sort by" options are empowering tools for users to create a better experience for themselves.</p>
                <p><b>Not all feedback is valuable feedback:</b>Without real-world users we relied on interviewees and usability feedback from outside our key demographic. We really had to evaluate the worth of changing and/or adding features based on user feedback that didn't necessarily align with the luxury fashion space.</p>
